//This is the master file for GarganUI meaning all styles will be derived from this list of variables 
//if anything is changed here it should flow down to like a "cascade" and change the look and sizing of all components 
//on the page. With the exception of _resets.scss.




//For development Tracking I wrote this backwards. Styled components the way I wanted them to look 
//then backtracked and added variables / functions to get the same effect but with base values from this file
