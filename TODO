TODO OVERALL 

-Liquor cards 
    -Change the type of alchohol and calorie count based on a object key / value 

-Liquor card selector 
    -lets you change the current selected type of liquor and renders the selected Liquor card 
    -infinite scroll ? (only 9 options currently so maybe unnecessary currently)

-Liquor total count fancy bubble 
    -a bubble with the total calories 
    -sticky and is always on screen 
    -grows larger the more drink consumed (based on shot counts vs calorie count?)
    




*- Optional feature 
    -chache all uses of the app to local storage so a user can reference all alchohol drank in total 
    -until reset ? vs per day / week ? 


-Liquor-Cat main page that opens with a first alchohol type 
    -calculations done in this page as it will be the "parent" for the others components 




TODO for calorie calculater 

changing total shot count shouldnt be on 1 increment but based on another value 
this logic should be tied to the increment buttons / type in amount of shots 

and after a value is selected then the handleShot should be run for the liquor selected 

    so two parts 
        -buttons that increment by one : immediate state update : OnClick 
        - typed value : updates when a new value is typed : onChange


    third part 
        -calculator function / useEffect should run as soon as the TotalShotsConsumed object changes 
        this will update its own piece of state totalCalories 










***JUN cool like entry animation for the app with the "logo" and a loading circle that will always last at least 

2 seconds to display the logo and the name of the app before rendering the first bottle 





***QUESTIONS 
    -why does useEffect updating state run twice and how to prevent 
        -it runs once then state is changed so it renders again (i assume is the logic)
            -how make it not do that
